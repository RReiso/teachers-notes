## Reflection
This was a three week long final project for the one month [All Aboard Bootcamp](https://github.com/All-Aboard-Bootcamp) taught by [John Crepezzi](https://github.com/seejohnrun). The requirements were to use Ruby and Ruby on Rails and build something that would be out of one's comfort zone and contribute to expanding one's skills and knowledge.

Coming from a teaching background, I know how important and at times difficult for teachers is to find suitable resources to use in class. Now that mostly classes are held online, teachers have a new challenge to find methods and materials applicable for online learning. I wanted to create a web application that would be a resource library for educators of short Zoom-friendly activities with ability to create and share activities and leave comments, tips, suggestions and appreciations for other teacher's activities.

One of the main difficulties I faced was distinguishing between the purposes of Model and Controller in the MVC pattern which led me to additional research and reading to be able to organise my code accordingly.
Most of the features I worked on were new to me and required a lot of research and debugging, but perseverance and love for coding give fruitful results.
